## Weekly Goals and TODOs

##### This contains our weekly goals as well as the tracked worked on tasks

### Week 2

#### Goals:

DeepSynergy:

-   rewrite DeepSynergy to PyTorch
-   Understand input for DS (DeepSynergy) mostly (with biological details) and present to group

DeepSignalingFlow:

-   Understand input for DSF (DeepSignalingFlow) mostly (with biological details) and present to group
-   Understanding all the operations of DSF with corresponding code pieces and present to group
    -   copy DSF elements to our GitHub

Both:

-   understand validation standard (leave blablabla out) for data leakage free validation
    -   test with DS
