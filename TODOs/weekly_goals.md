## Weekly Goals and TODOs

##### This contains our weekly goals as well as the tracked worked on tasks

### Week 2

#### Goals:

DeepSynergy:

-   rewrite DeepSynergy to PyTorch
-   Understand input for DS (DeepSynergy) mostly (with biological details) and present to group

DeepSignalingFlow:

-   Understand input for DSF (DeepSignalingFlow) mostly (with biological details) and present to group
-   Understanding all the operations of DSF with corresponding code pieces and present to group
    -   copy DSF elements to our GitHub

Both:

-   understand validation standard (leave blablabla out) for data leakage free validation
    -   test with DS

        Gained deep understanding of DeepSynergy Code Basis and made iypnb files to teach this knowledge easier (See DeepSynergy iypnb files). 
        Gained understanding of the validation approach, open issue of how the folds were created remains however. 
        Learned about pytorch implementation to have one coding language for both projects. Read a bit into binet, the library they used. 
        Took a look at the data sets and a deep look at the normalisation approach and how they found their hyperparameters.

        - Researched various biological terms related to the topic Deepsynergy and translated them into an easy-to-understand format.
        - Uploaded an explanation-file in "Deepsynergy" 
        - Revisited the overall concept and reviewed the code again to deepen my understanding.
